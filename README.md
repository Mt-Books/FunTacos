### Hypothesis
The execution-time to find the value of the worst case scenario increases as the size of the matrix increases.

### Background
In the matrix, the smallest number is located at the top left. The values of the numbers to the right and bottom as each number increases. The worst case scenario in all matrices, no matter the size, would be located at the bottom left of the matrix.

### Experiment
The algorithm we've developed would execute the following...
* To show that the execution-time increases as the size of the matrix increases, we are going to create 100 matrices with the size ranging between 100 and 10,000.
* For each of the matrices, we will be conducting 50 trials, and then finding the average of their execution-time.
*

### Results


### Conclusion
Our hypothesis is partially true. According to he data we've gathered, the execution-time increases overall, but between two adjacent matrices, the execution-time can go either way.
