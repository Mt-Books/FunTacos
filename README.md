## Hypothesis
The execution-time to find the value of the worst case scenario increases as the size of the matrix increases.

## Background
In the matrix, the smallest number is located at the top left. The values of the numbers to the right and bottom of each number increases.

## Experiment
The worst case scenario in all matrixes, no matter what size, is located at the bottom right of the matrix. To show that the execution-time increases as the size of the matrix increases, we are going to create 50 matrixes with the size ranging between 1 and 10,000. For each of the matrixes, we will be conducting 20 trials and then finding the average of each matrix's data.
