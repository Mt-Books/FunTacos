## Hypothesis
The execution-time to find the value of the worst case scenario increases as the size of the matrix increases.

## Background
In the matrix, the smallest number is located at the top left. The values of the numbers to the right and bottom of each number increases.

## Experiment
The worst case scenario in all matrixes, no matter what size, is located at the bottom right of the matrix. To show that the execution-time increases as the size of the matrix increases, we are going to create 50 matrixes with the size ranging between 1000 and 100,000. For each of the matrixes, we will be conducting 20 trials and then finding the average of each matrix's data.
